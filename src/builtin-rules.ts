// ─── Built-in rules deployment ──────────────────────────
//
//  CLI ships with built-in rules that guide AI tool behavior.
//  Unlike team repo rules (managed by users), these are
//  maintained alongside the CLI code and deployed automatically
//  on each `teamai pull`.
//
//  Built-in rules are generated in-memory (no external files).
//  On each `teamai pull` / `teamai init`:
//    → ~/.claude/rules/teamai-recall.md
//    → ~/.claude-internal/rules/teamai-recall.md
//    → ~/.cursor/rules/teamai-recall.md
//    → ...
//

When you encounter errors, bugs, deployment issues, or unfamiliar patterns during this session, **search the team knowledge base first** before attempting to solve from scratch.

## How to Search

Run the following command via Bash:

\`\`\`bash
teamai recall "<search query>"
\`\`\`

## When to Search

- Encountering an error message or stack trace
- Debugging deployment or infrastructure issues
- Working with unfamiliar APIs, services, or configurations
- Before implementing a workaround for a known problem area

## How to Use Results

- Results are ranked by relevance (title ×3, tags ×2, body ×1) plus team votes
- Use the \`Read\` tool to read the full document at the path shown in results
- Apply the solution or pattern described, adapting to your current context
- If no results are found, proceed normally — the knowledge base is still growing

## Example

\`\`\`bash
teamai recall "API timeout retry"
teamai recall "K8s OOM pod restart"
teamai recall "SGLang deployment"
\`\`\`
`;
