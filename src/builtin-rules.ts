// ─── Built-in rules deployment ──────────────────────────
//
//  CLI ships with built-in rules that guide AI tool behavior.
//  Unlike team repo rules (managed by users), these are
//  maintained alongside the CLI code and deployed automatically
//  on each `teamai pull`.
//
//  Currently no built-in rules are deployed — auto-recall hooks
//  replaced the old teamai-recall.md rule. The infrastructure
//  is kept for future built-in rules.
//
//  Legacy cleanup: removes old teamai-recall.md files on pull.
//
